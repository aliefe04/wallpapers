# Wallpapers

Just a rather overengineered wallpaper repository :) 

Why? 

**R:** Why not? Also, I was bored

## Automations

![Update all README.md](https://github.com/gustavodiel/wallpapers/workflows/Update%20all%20README.md/badge.svg)

## Contributing

All wallppers are welcome (except NSFW :eyes:)! Always remember to try and check the source and update the README ;) 

Also, if you know the source of any wallpaper, please enlighten us!

## Usage

Adding a new wallpaper:
 - Place your image (preferably .png or .jpg) inside the correct folder, based on it's aspect ratio (or create a new one if it makes sense)
 - Run `python create_missing_yml.py` (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)]) and fill in the information on the generated files
 - (optional) Run `python create_readme.py` in order to see the final rendered Readme. This is optional because this repo includes a Github action that automatically runs this script
 - - This script will also generate a thumbnail image so that the front page is faster to load
